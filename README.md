# Cinema Ticketing App

This project is a **Cinema Ticketing APP** built with **Node.js**, **JavaScript**, and **MongoDB**. 

It's an evolution of **"Ticket.JS"**, where I built a super simple cinema ticket app with JavaScript. Now, I'll try to use my full knowledge.

## Technologies Used

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) - MongoDB object modeling
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - Environment variable management
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## Current Features

- CRUD operations for movies

- Crud operations for user
- Script for inserting users
- Database running on **localhost** 
  - OBS: Initially planned for MongoDB Atlas, but i'm using local setup due to network issues.
